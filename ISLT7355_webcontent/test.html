             <p>Hi Elizabeth! I am trying out your <small>HTML small element</small> let's see how it works!</p>
                 <p>I think this would be great to use in something like an advertisment where they include terms and conditions in small print at the bottom</p>
                    <p><small>Something like thisdown at the bottom of the page in fine print! What a great element to learn</small></p>
