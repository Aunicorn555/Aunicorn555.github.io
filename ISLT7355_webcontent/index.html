      <h2>Hello,</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Ashley Phillips. I am a graduate student at the University of
        Missouri. Welcome to my portfolio page!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here you will find various artifacts I have created so far in my masters
        program. These artifacts demonstrate my skills and competencies. I
        designed and developed this website myself using HTML5 and CSS3. I hope
        you have fun exploring while you get to know me and my work a little
        better. <br /><br />
        ~Enjoy!
