      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Ashley Phillips. I am a highly adaptive full-time
        graduate student at the University of Missouri. I have a BS in Business
        Administration from William Woods University. And I am currently
        pursuing my master's in Learning Technologies and Design. I plan to
        graduate in the Fall of 2023. I am a natural-born leader and problem
        solver that takes pride in my work. I am passionate about instructional
        design and eLearning course development. My number one focus is on
        creating an impact. Creating courses allows me to wield my creativity
        and make a noticeable impact every day. In fact, one of my favorites
        quotes by Marian Wright Eldeman is:
      </p>
      <br />
      <blockquote>
        "<em
          >Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your
          community and world better than you found it</em
        >"
      </blockquote>
      <p>~ Marian Wright Edelman</p>
