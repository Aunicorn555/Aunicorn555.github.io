      Hello everyone, it's nice to meet you! My name is Ashley Phillips, I am a
      wife and mother of two ((Thaddeus 6 and Daisey 8)) and one Yorkie mix,
      names Tootsie-Woo-Who. I have a BS in business administration, and this is
      my third semester here at Mizzou. As far as my experience with web
      development goes, I have taken a couple of courses on Udemy and LinkedIn.
      I have created a few websites in the past, but I could definetly use some
      formal training. Which is why I am here. I hope to gain a solid foundation
      of HTML/CSS including RWD, accessibility, and the illusive flexbox and
      grid page layouts. By the time I complete this course, I want to be able
      to create a website and professional portfolio for myself, and be able to
      code and fix basic webpages. Some of my hobbies and interests include:
      cooking, eating, painting (acrylic pour & abstract), learning new tech and
      software.
