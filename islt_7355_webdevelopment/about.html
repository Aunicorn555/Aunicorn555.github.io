    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is <strong>Ashley Phillips</strong>. I am a highly adaptive
      full-time graduate student at the University of Missouri. I have a BS in
      Business Administration from William Woods University. And I am currently
      pursuing my master's in Learning Technologies and Design. I plan to
      graduate in the Fall of 2023. I am a natural-born problem solver that
      takes pride in my work. I am passionate about instructional design and
      eLearning course development. My number one focus is on
      <strong>creating an impact</strong>. Creating courses allows me to wield
      my creativity and make a noticeable impact every day. In fact, one of my
      favorites quotes by Marian Wright Eldeman is:
    </p>
    <br />
    <blockquote>
      "<em
        >Education is for improving the lives of others and for leaving your
        community and world better than you found it</em
      >"
    </blockquote>
    <p>~ Marian Wright Edelman</p>
